This will be a sudoku prgoram written in Python supporting dimeonsions of n by n, greater than typical 3x3 sudokus. 

This will feature the abilities to generate as well as solve n by n sudokus.

The reference I used for this project is Peter Norvig's algorithm for solving sudokus, which can be found at: http://norvig.com/sudoku.html
